    ├── core_functionalities.md      # High-level features and functionality

    └── architecture.md              # System architecture and flow
```

## 📌 Getting Started

1. Review `docs/core_functionalities.md` for the overall vision.
2. See `docs/mvp_specification.md` for the first development phase.
3. Review `docs/architecture.md` for the technical system layout.
4. Choose your stack (e.g., FastAPI + React or Python CLI) and start building the MVP.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- Phase 1: Text-based chat with memory and personality
- Phase 2: Voice interface, avatar support
- Phase 3: Smart home/media integrations
- Phase 4: Deep emotional intelligence + long-term memory

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

The project is being built with a strong emphasis on user safety, emotional well-being, and transparency. Memory is local by default, and romantic simulation features are optional.
