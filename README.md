# AI Companion Project

This project aims to develop an AI-powered emotional support and relationship simulation companion that users can interact with through natural conversations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The AI Companion offers:
- Emotionally intelligent and context-aware conversations
- Customizable personalities and daily check-ins
- Lightweight memory for personalization
- A modular design ready for future expansion

## 📁 Project Structure

```
ai-companion-project/
└── docs/
    ├── core_functionalities.md      # High-level features and functionality
    └── mvp_specification.md         # MVP use cases, features, and tech stack
```

## 📌 Getting Started

1. Review `docs/core_functionalities.md` for the overall vision.
2. See `docs/mvp_specification.md` for the first development phase.
3. Choose your stack (e.g., FastAPI + React or Python CLI) and start building the MVP.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- Phase 1: Text-based chat with memory and personality
- Phase 2: Voice interface, avatar support
- Phase 3: Smart home/media integrations
- Phase 4: Deep emotional intelligence + long-term memory

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

The project is being built with a strong emphasis on user safety, emotional well-being, and transparency. Memory is local by default, and romantic simulation features are optional.
